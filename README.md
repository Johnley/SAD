####Submitting a PR
So you found a bug, or you want to add a feature?  Think you can make it more efficient?  Want to help in general?  Great!

1. If you haven't already, create a Github account.
2. Click the `Fork` icon located at the top-right of this page (below your username).
3. Make the changes that you want to and commit them.
	* If you're making changes locally, you'll have to do `git commit -a` and `git push` in your command line.
4. Click `Pull Request` at the right-hand side of the gray bar directly below your fork's name.
5. Click `Click to create a pull request for this comparison`, enter your PR's title, and create a detailed description telling everyone what you changed.
6. Click `Send pull request`, and wait for feedback!

####Creating an Issue

1. Make sure your issue hasn't already been answered or fixed.  Also think about whether your issue is a valid one before submitting it.
2. Go to [the issues page](http://github.com/Johnley/SAD/issues).
3. Click `New Issue`.
4. Enter your Issue's title (something that summarizes your issue), and then create a detailed description ("Hey John, could you add/change xxx?" or "Hey, found an exploit:  stuff").
5. Click `Submit new issue`, and wait for feedback!
