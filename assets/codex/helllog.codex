    "(Transcribed by Hylotl prisoner #0451)<br>Another prisoner needs stabbing. Stab. Floran prisoner. Lost his mind.<br>(The Floran guard mutters something vaguely menacing at me)<br>Cut him down. Return him to soil. Floran rest.<br>(Floran guard shakes a spear in my direction. I narrowly avoid it.)",

    "His cocoon-kin shall be notified.<br>His dying screams will haunt me to the end of my days. As I lay down to sleep, those blood-curdling cries will be forever with me. Such suffering.<br>(I have added this last portion myself, but I'm sure that's what the Floran guard meant by his departing, unintelligible grunts and hisses.)"
