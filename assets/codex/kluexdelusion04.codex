    "by Rochard Hawkwings<br>I received a reply from Apex leader Big Ape, which I shall reprint in the pages of this book:",

    "'Sup,<br>Big Ape, here. Kluex, you say? A god? An Avian god? Big Ape is not familiar with this individual. But Big Ape will be happy to challenge your god Kluex to a no-holds-barred cage match, to prove ape superiority once and for all. Any time, any place, anything goes. The Miniknog are always ready.<br>Love,<br>Glorious Leader Big Ape'",


    "It remains to be seen whether Kluex will accept this offer."
