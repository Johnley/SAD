    "A Prayer to Kluex<br>by Anonymous<br><br>Dear Kluex, save us from the storm. <br>Our wings are gone, our feathers torn. <br>We walk the earth, but long to soar,<br>We cannot take off any more.",

    "Oh Kluex, with your glorious might,<br>Come bless us now and give us flight. <br>We serve you as you make your plans,<br>Oh, let us fly to promised lands."
