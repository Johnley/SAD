    "Florans live in trees<br>Hylotl swim the seas<br>But we are the Avians<br>And the air is where we'll be!",

    "Our wings they work no more<br>But in our ships we soar<br>And if the Council come aboard<br>We'll toss them to the floor!",

    "We'll sail across the skies<br>Shoot down our elders' lies<br>Cos when you face the Grounded<br>We will take you by surprise!",

    "Our ships don't make a sound<br>Our feet don't touch the ground<br>We'll fly our boats right into space<br>We're going to be starbound!"
